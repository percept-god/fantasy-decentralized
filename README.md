# fantasy-decentralized
A public, open-source platform for collaborative story writing

# Rules:
1.	Don’t ruin it.
2.	Everything can be changed, even the rules.
3.	Every change must be approved by one admin.
4.	All work is publicly hosted.
5.	Every new story must be within 10 years of any previous story. New locations should be created in reference to existing locations.
6.	Any new story must be given a new file with a clearly labeled date.
7.	The maximum story length is 10k words. The minimum story length is 500 words.
8.	For each story that you create, you may edit one story. This means that you either edit your own work or edit another person’s work, but not both.
9.	No new additions may be inconsistent with existing work. Modifications that would affect the existing story must be accompanied by self-consistent changes to the existing work.
10.	No erotica, racism, or bigotry.
11.	Read the story in its entirety before contributing for the first time.
12. Upload files in .pdf format.
# Premise:
1.	Every contributing author is a member of a pantheon, manipulating characters and influencing events in subtle ways. They carry out an inscrutable game for hundreds of years, shaping the history of a world.
2.	Authors are totally free to construct, or to not construct a character for their god, manifest through their actions within the story.
3.	The point is decentralized imagination: anything you make can and probably will be reshaped/twisted by other contributors. However, version control will keep a painstaking record of your actions: watch out for vengeful gods.
